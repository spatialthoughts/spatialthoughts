## Ujaval Gandhi

I am the founder of [Spatial Thoughts Academy](https://spatialthoughts.com/) and author of several open-source learning resources. The technologies I primarily work with are **QGIS**, **Python**, **GDAL** and **Google Earth Engine**. I am strong believer in open-source, open-data and open-learning materials.

You can check out my work through the links below.

- [QGIS Tutorials and Tips](http://www.qgistutorials.com/): Available in 10+ languages and used by 1M+ users every year. Covers all topics suitable from beginner to advanced users with step-by-step instructions. Built using *RST/Sphinx/Github Pages*.
